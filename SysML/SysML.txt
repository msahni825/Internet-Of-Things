The Systems Modeling Language is a general-purpose modeling language for systems engineering applications. 
It supports the specification, analysis, design, verification and validation of a broad range of systems and systems-of-systems.

SysML 

1. SysML offers improvements over UML, which tends to be software-centric. SysML semantics more flexible and expressive.

2. MBS, Reduced errors and ambiguity. More complete representation.Enhances knowledge capture

3. SysML reduces UML's software-centric restrictions and adds two new diagram types, requirement and parametric diagrams.

4. can be used for requirements engineering. SysML is a dialect of UML 2, which extends the Unified Modeling Language (UML) standard for software-intensive applications so that it can be successfully 
applied to Systems Engineering applications.

5. SysML is able to model a wide range of systems, which may include hardware, software, information, processes, personnel, and facilities.

6. Since SysML removes many of UML's software-centric constructs, the overall language is smaller both in diagram types and total constructs.

7. SysML is an enabling technology for Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). Use cases in UML captures functional and not non-functional requirements.

8. SysML: visual modelling language, that provides semantics(meaning). Not a tool/methodology.

9. Used to mprove the precision and efficiency of your communications with fellow Systems Engineers and other system and business stakeholders 
(e.g., Clients, Software Engineers, Electrical Engineers, Mechanical Engineers), then you should consider using a system architecture modeling language
